# Automated-movement-detection-and-Biomechanical-Analysis
This project applies ‘pose estimation’ (MediaPipe) and signal processing to detect and analyze goblet squat repetitions from video. It is designed for sports performance analysis, rehabilitation monitoring, and as a demonstration of combining biomechanics with computer vision.
